I. Node (vanilla js, no "web app" or HTML / CSS)
    * Introduction to "modular" javascript (maybe include info about typescript)
    * Simple "Calculator" (add / subtract 2 numbers, parse arguments to make sure they are "number"-like)
    * Async / Promise-based testing (using JSON placeholder service https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
    * jest "mocks" for imports / function calls
II. Vue
    * Introduction to web components (composition, reusability, inter-component communication)
    * Separation of business and presentation logic
    * basic HTML unit testing (text matches, element contains child element, callback is called on click event, etc)
    * Snapshot HTML testing
    * VERY basic Mirage demonstration
